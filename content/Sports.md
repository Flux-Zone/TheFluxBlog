These are my favourite sports:

1. Soccer/Football
2. Basketball
3. Cricket

Out of all the previous sports mentioned I would have to say Cricket has the most cultural reference to me. Cricket is a popular bat-and-ball sport played between two teams, each consisting of 11 players. Originating in England, it has grown into one of the most widely followed sports, especially in countries like India, Australia, England, Pakistan, and South Africa.
