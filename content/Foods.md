These are my favourite fruits

- Apple
- Banana
- Watermelon


Out of these 3 fruits Watermelon HAS to be my favourite. Watermelon is a large, juicy fruit with a hard, green rind and sweet, red or pink flesh filled with small black seeds. Known for its high water content (about 90%), it's a refreshing, hydrating snack, especially popular during summer. Watermelon is rich in vitamins A and C and contains antioxidants like lycopene, which gives the flesh its bright red color.
