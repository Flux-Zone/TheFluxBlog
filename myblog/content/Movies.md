Here are 3 movies which I like:

1) Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse
2) Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse
3) Avengers: Infinity War

Here is a short description of one of the movies an a picture of it artstyle wise.

"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse" follows Miles Morales, a teenager who gains spider-like abilities after being bitten by a radioactive spider. When a villain's machine opens portals to alternate dimensions, multiple versions of Spider-Man from different universes are pulled into Miles' world.
